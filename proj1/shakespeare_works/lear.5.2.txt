Alarum within  Enter  with drum and colours   KING LEAR  CORDELIA  and Soldiers  over the stage  and exeunt


Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER


Here  father  take the shadow of this tree
For your good host  pray that the right may thrive 
If ever I return to you again 
I ll bring you comfort 


Grace go with you  sir 
Exit EDGAR
Alarum and retreat within  Re enter EDGAR


Away  old man  give me thy hand  away 
King Lear hath lost  he and his daughter ta en 
Give me thy hand  come on 


No farther  sir  a man may rot even here 


What  in ill thoughts again  Men must endure
Their going hence  even as their coming hither 
Ripeness is all  come on 


And that s true too 
Exeunt

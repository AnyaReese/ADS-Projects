Flourish  Enter KING EDWARD IV  GLOUCESTER  CLARENCE 	and soldiers  with QUEEN MARGARET  OXFORD  and	SOMERSET  prisoners
Now here a period of tumultuous broils 
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight 
For Somerset  off with his guilty head 
Go  bear them hence  I will not hear them speak 


For my part  I ll not trouble thee with words 

Nor I  but stoop with patience to my fortune 

Exeunt Oxford and Somerset  guarded
So part we sadly in this troublous world 
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem 


Is proclamation made  that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward  and he his life 


It is  and lo  where youthful Edward comes 

Enter soldiers  with PRINCE EDWARD
Bring forth the gallant  let us hear him speak 
What  can so young a thorn begin to prick 
Edward  what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms  for stirring up my subjects 
And all the trouble thou hast turn d me to 


Speak like a subject  proud ambitious York 
Suppose that I am now my father s mouth 
Resign thy chair  and where I stand kneel thou 
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee 
Which traitor  thou wouldst have me answer to 


Ah  that thy father had been so resolved 

That you might still have worn the petticoat 
And ne er have stol n the breech from Lancaster 


Let AEsop fable in a winter s night 
His currish riddles sort not with this place 


By heaven  brat  I ll plague ye for that word 

Ay  thou wast born to be a plague to men 

For God s sake  take away this captive scold 

Nay  take away this scolding crookback rather 

Peace  wilful boy  or I will charm your tongue 

Untutor d lad  thou art too malapert 

I know my duty  you are all undutiful 
Lascivious Edward  and thou perjured George 
And thou mis shapen Dick  I tell ye all
I am your better  traitors as ye are 
And thou usurp st my father s right and mine 


Take that  thou likeness of this railer here 

Stabs him
Sprawl st thou  take that  to end thy agony 

Stabs him
And there s for twitting me with perjury 

Stabs him
O  kill me too 

Marry  and shall 

Offers to kill her
Hold  Richard  hold  for we have done too much 

Why should she live  to fill the world with words 

What  doth she swoon  use means for her recovery 

Clarence  excuse me to the king my brother 
I ll hence to London on a serious matter 
Ere ye come there  be sure to hear some news 


What  what 

The Tower  the Tower 

Exit
O Ned  sweet Ned  speak to thy mother  boy 
Canst thou not speak  O traitors  murderers 
They that stabb d Caesar shed no blood at all 
Did not offend  nor were not worthy blame 
If this foul deed were by to equal it 
He was a man  this  in respect  a child 
And men ne er spend their fury on a child 
What s worse than murderer  that I may name it 
No  no  my heart will burst  and if I speak 
And I will speak  that so my heart may burst 
Butchers and villains  bloody cannibals 
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp d 
You have no children  butchers  if you had 
The thought of them would have stirr d up remorse 
But if you ever chance to have a child 
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As  deathmen  you have rid this sweet young prince 


Away with her  go  bear her hence perforce 

Nay  never bear me hence  dispatch me here 
Here sheathe thy sword  I ll pardon thee my death 
What  wilt thou not  then  Clarence  do it thou 


By heaven  I will not do thee so much ease 

Good Clarence  do  sweet Clarence  do thou do it 

Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it 

Ay  but thou usest to forswear thyself 
 Twas sin before  but now  tis charity 
What  wilt thou not  Where is that devil s butcher 
Hard favour d Richard  Richard  where art thou 
Thou art not here  murder is thy alms deed 
Petitioners for blood thou ne er put st back 


Away  I say  I charge ye  bear her hence 

So come to you and yours  as to this Prince 

Exit  led out forcibly
Where s Richard gone 

To London  all in post  and  as I guess 
To make a bloody supper in the Tower 


He s sudden  if a thing comes in his head 
Now march we hence  discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks  and let s away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares 
By this  I hope  she hath a son for me 


Exeunt

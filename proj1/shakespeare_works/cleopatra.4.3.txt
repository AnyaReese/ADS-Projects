Enter two Soldiers to their guard


Brother  good night  to morrow is the day 


It will determine one way  fare you well 
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets 


Nothing  What news 


Belike  tis but a rumour  Good night to you 


Well  sir  good night 
Enter two other Soldiers


Soldiers  have careful watch 


And you  Good night  good night 
They place themselves in every corner of the stage


Here we  and if to morrow
Our navy thrive  I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up 


 Tis a brave army 
And full of purpose 
Music of the hautboys as under the stage


Peace  what noise 


List  list 


Hark 


    Music i  the air 


Under the earth 


It signs well  does it not 


No 


Peace  I say 
What should this mean 


 Tis the god Hercules  whom Antony loved 
Now leaves him 


Walk  let s see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do 
They advance to another post


How now  masters 


 Speaking together   How now 
How now  do you hear this 


Ay  is t not strange 


Do you hear  masters  do you hear 


Follow the noise so far as we have quarter 
Let s see how it will give off 


Content   Tis strange 
Exeunt

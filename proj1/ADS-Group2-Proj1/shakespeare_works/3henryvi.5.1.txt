Enter WARWICK  the Mayor of Coventry  two Messengers 	and others upon the walls
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford 
How far hence is thy lord  mine honest fellow 


By this at Dunsmore  marching hitherward 

How far off is our brother Montague 
Where is the post that came from Montague 


By this at Daintry  with a puissant troop 

Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
Say  Somerville  what says my loving son 
And  by thy guess  how nigh is Clarence now 


At Southam I did leave him with his forces 
And do expect him here some two hours hence 


Drum heard
Then Clarence is at hand  I hear his drum 

It is not his  my lord  here Southam lies 
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick 


Who should that be  belike  unlook d for friends 

They are at hand  and you shall quickly know 

March  flourish  Enter KING EDWARD IV  GLOUCESTER 	and soldiers
Go  trumpet  to the walls  and sound a parle 

See how the surly Warwick mans the wall 

O unbid spite  is sportful Edward come 
Where slept our scouts  or how are they seduced 
That we could hear no news of his repair 


Now  Warwick  wilt thou ope the city gates 
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee 
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy 
And he shall pardon thee these outrages 


Nay  rather  wilt thou draw thy forces hence 
Confess who set thee up and pluck d thee own 
Call Warwick patron and be penitent 
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York 


I thought  at least  he would have said the king 
Or did he make the jest against his will 


Is not a dukedom  sir  a goodly gift 

Ay  by my faith  for a poor earl to give 
I ll do thee service for so good a gift 


 Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother 

Why then  tis mine  if but by Warwick s gift 

Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight 
And weakling  Warwick takes his gift again 
And Henry is my king  Warwick his subject 


But Warwick s king is Edward s prisoner 
And  gallant Warwick  do but answer this 
What is the body when the head is off 


Alas  that Warwick had no more forecast 
But  whiles he thought to steal the single ten 
The king was slily finger d from the deck 
You left poor Henry at the Bishop s palace 
And  ten to one  you ll meet him in the Tower 


 Tis even so  yet you are Warwick still 

Come  Warwick  take the time  kneel down  kneel down 
Nay  when  strike now  or else the iron cools 


I had rather chop this hand off at a blow 
And with the other fling it at thy face 
Than bear so low a sail  to strike to thee 


Sail how thou canst  have wind and tide thy friend 
This hand  fast wound about thy coal black hair
Shall  whiles thy head is warm and new cut off 
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood 
 Wind changing Warwick now can change no more  


Enter OXFORD  with drum and colours
O cheerful colours  see where Oxford comes 

Oxford  Oxford  for Lancaster 

He and his forces enter the city
The gates are open  let us enter too 

So other foes may set upon our backs 
Stand we in good array  for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle 
If not  the city being but of small defence 
We ll quickly rouse the traitors in the same 


O  welcome  Oxford  for we want thy help 

Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
Montague  Montague  for Lancaster 

He and his forces enter the city
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear 


The harder match d  the greater victory 
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest 


Enter SOMERSET  with drum and colours
Somerset  Somerset  for Lancaster 

He and his forces enter the city
Two of thy name  both Dukes of Somerset 
Have sold their lives unto the house of York 
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold 


Enter CLARENCE  with drum and colours
And lo  where George of Clarence sweeps along 
Of force enough to bid his brother battle 
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother s love 
Come  Clarence  come  thou wilt  if Warwick call 


Father of Warwick  know you what this means 

Taking his red rose out of his hat

Look here  I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father s house 
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together 
And set up Lancaster  Why  trow st thou  Warwick 
That Clarence is so harsh  so blunt  unnatural 
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king 
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath 
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah s  when he sacrificed his daughter 
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That  to deserve well at my brother s hands 
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe 
With resolution  wheresoe er I meet thee  
As I will meet thee  if thou stir abroad  
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me 
And so  proud hearted Warwick  I defy thee 
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks 
Pardon me  Edward  I will make amends 
And  Richard  do not frown upon my faults 
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant 


Now welcome more  and ten times more beloved 
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate 


Welcome  good Clarence  this is brotherlike 

O passing traitor  perjured and unjust 

What  Warwick  wilt thou leave the town and fight 
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears 


Alas  I am not coop d here for defence 
I will away towards Barnet presently 
And bid thee battle  Edward  if thou darest 


Yes  Warwick  Edward dares  and leads the way 
Lords  to the field  Saint George and victory 


Exeunt King Edward and his company  March  Warwick	and his company follow

Hopper and Turton (2000)
The methods used by Hopper and Turton to create their data sets are described in detail in Hopper's PhD dissertation. Three algorithms were used to generate each problem subset. The first algorithm chooses a rectangle, assigns a random point in the rectangle, then splits the rectangle into four pieces by means of a horizontal cut and a vertical cut through the point. The second algorithm randomly chooses an edge of an initial rectangle, assigns a random point on the edge, mirrors the point on the opposite edge and splits the rectangle through the line between the two points. The non-guillotineable benchmark generator selects an initial large rectangle, randomly assigns two points in the rectangle and creates a pattern of five smaller rectangles in a non-guillotine pattern. Half of the instances in the larger benchmark set were generated by one of the guillotineable algorithms, and the other half by the non-guillotineable algorithm. The aspect ratios of all rectangles satisfy the constraint 1/7≤hi/wi≤7. The smaller benchmark set consists of an equal number of instances created by each of the three algorithms.
